== SWMTBot 1.19.0 ==

=== Changes in 1.19.0 ===

* Bumped Console.msgs version to 2.02
* Meaningless messages are now discarded

* Limit flow rate - Properly implemented. ConnectionError no longer occurs, as
  we are now using a hacked version of SmartIrc4net (workaround). SWMTBot is now
  flood-protected in code

=== Changes in x ===

* Auto-download lists now searches for a <ul> instead of an <ol> on
  [[Special:Listusers]] following the change in MediaWiki
* If a local admin blocks a user, then the name of the wiki will be recorded
in
  the blacklist reason
* Unmatched log types now return more debug data via the Distributed Debugging
  feature
* Changed various error messages to be more apparent as to their cause

=== New features in 1.16.0 untill 1.17.1 ===

* Options for editblank, editbig, newbig, newsmall moved from static integers
to the .ini configuration
* "purge" command added
* "batchreload" commands added
* AutoReconnect
* Support for deletions, now reported in rc stream
* Limit flow rate - implemented. Translated code from CVUBot; SWMTBot is now
  aware of the flood protection that freenode uses and should not get flooded
off
  easily. (However, response times may have gone down somewhat)
* Allow broadcasting to be turned off - implemented. If you specify None
(case-sensitive) for the broadcastchannel in SWMTBot.ini, broadcasting will be
turned off entirely

=== Bug fixes in 1.16.0 untill 1.17.1 ===

* Empty messages are prevented from being send and from crashing the bot
* Fixed a bug whereby usercreate2 (when a user creates an account for somebody
  else) was showing up as normal usercreate
* Handled OnConnectionError, which will hopefully reduce or totally eliminate
  the strange object disposal exceptions

  URL
