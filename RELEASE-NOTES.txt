== SWMTBot 1.20.0 ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

Those wishing to use the trunk code instead of a stable release can obtain
it from source control: https://svn.toolserver.org/svnroot/p_swmtbot

=== Changes in 1.20.0 ===

* "the end of time" is now controlled by Console.msgs to allow translation
* newuser/newuser2 event gets a talkurl attribute
* delete event gets a url attribute
* actions now have a clean-attribute (cname) besides the regular one. For
  more flexibility in the layout of the messages. Enabling [[]] (renders
  "[[xx:User:Foo]]") and  (renders "Foo")
* (bug 15) Add {talkurl} attribute for block and unblock event

=== New features in 1.20.0 ===

* (bug 12) Trim whitespace when dealing with list manager
* (bug 29) A few of the requested feed filters added: feedFilterUsersAnon, feedFilterUsersReg, feedFilterEventUpload
* (bug 30) Setting to avoid database connection ListManager.ClassifyEditor. Can now be done with setting disableClassifyEditor in SWMTBot.ini

=== Bug fixes in 1.20.0 ===

* SWMTUtils.wikiEncode() now encodes exclamation mark aswell (some IRC
  clients cut off link of pagetitle contained it)
* (bug 11) added clean-attributes missing for edit/newpage
* (bug 16) Remove deprecated {ipcat}

== Compatibility & Upgrading ==

The old deprecated {ipcat} attribute (which previously was manually set to an
empty string) has been removed from the Program and Console.msgs. Make sure
you keep the Console.msgs up to date aswell, since else it'll display
"{ipcat}" litterly in your bot messages.

Lists.sqlite, SWMTBot.ini and Projects.xml remain unchanged and don't need
upgrading. All other files can simply be replaced, and restart the bot.
